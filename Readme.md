## Concept

Upwork Genie is an AI-powered tool built using OpenAIâ€™s CustomGPT, designed to enhance freelancers' success on Upwork. It searches for the most relevant job postings based on provided keywords or the user's skillset and generates customized proposals by analyzing top-performing examples.

This GPT system not only saves time by automating the job search process but also increases the chances of winning projects by using the latest proposal strategies. Remember, always use the browsing tool to check for the most current templates and strategies by searching terms like "Upwork Proposal Reddit" at least three times before finalizing any proposal.

Important Note: Upwork Genie is designed as a Proof of Concept (POC) and is NOT recommended for production environments due to potential security risks.
